# Lab Rats 2 Mods

My mods for Lab Rats 2.


## [Mods](Mods/)

- [Dress Code Policy - Minimum Sluttiness](Mods/DressCodePolicy-MinSluttiness/)  
Adds a couple of dress code policies that add a minimum sluttiness requirement to the employees' outfits. Includes disobedience events along the lines of the existing uniform events.
- [Investor Representative Visits with Cum](Mods/InvestRepVisitCum/)  
Adds a small chance with high sluttiness and high obedience that seducing the representative ends with cum stains on the employee.
- [Modify Outfit](Mods/ModifyOutfit/)  
Adds an option to modify a person's existing outfits to the "Change your wardrobe" command.
- [Separate Clothing Transparency](Mods/SeparateClothingTransparency/)  
Makes transparency of the different colors on multi-colored clothing items independent from one another (e.g., to allow a non-transparent belt or scarf on an otherwise transparent item).
- [Type Any Transparency](Mods/TypeAnyTransparency/)  
Allows to type in any transparency (opacity) value for clothing items by clicking on the current value (to the right of the given opacity options).
