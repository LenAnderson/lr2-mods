# Lab Rats 2 Mods

My mods for Lab Rats 2.

- [Dress Code Policy - Minimum Sluttiness](DressCodePolicy-MinSluttiness/)  
Adds a couple of dress code policies that add a minimum sluttiness requirement to the employees' outfits. Includes disobedience events along the lines of the existing uniform events.
- [Investor Representative Visits with Cum](InvestRepVisitCum/)  
Adds a small chance with high sluttiness and high obedience that seducing the representative ends with cum stains on the employee.
- [Modify Outfit](ModifyOutfit/)  
Adds an option to modify a person's existing outfits to the "Change your wardrobe" command.
- ~~[Separate Clothing Transparency](SeparateClothingTransparency/)~~  
**obsolete** - *this has been integrated into the Lab Rats 2 Bugfix Mod*  
Makes transparency of the different colors on multi-colored clothing items independent from one another (e.g., to allow a non-transparent belt or scarf on an otherwise transparent item).
- ~~[Type Any Transparency](TypeAnyTransparency/)~~  
**obsolete** - *this has been integrated into the Unofficial Lab Rats 2 Expansion*  
Allows to type in any transparency (opacity) value for clothing items by clicking on the current value (to the right of the given opacity options).
